# Logo Integration Instructions

To properly display the Maevie logo throughout the application, please follow these steps:

1. Save the Maevie logo image you provided to this directory (`frontend/src/assets/`) with the filename `maevie-logo.png`

2. The application is already configured to import and display this logo in:
   - The navigation bar
   - The login page 
   - The registration page

3. No code changes are needed after adding the image file - the React components will automatically import and display it.

## Alternative Approach

If you prefer to use the logo directly from the public directory:

1. Save the Maevie logo to `frontend/public/images/maevie-logo.png`
2. Update the image paths in the components to use `/images/maevie-logo.png` instead of the imported version

Thank you for providing the beautiful Maevie logo!
